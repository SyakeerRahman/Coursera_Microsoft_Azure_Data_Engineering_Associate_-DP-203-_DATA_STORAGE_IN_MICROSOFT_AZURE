By default, storage accounts accept connections from
clients on any network. To limit access to
selected networks, you must first change
the default action. You can restrict access
to specific IP addresses, ranges and virtual networks. Be careful as changing
network rules can affect your application's ability
to connect to Azure Storage. If you set the default
network rule to deny, you'll block all access
to the data unless specific network
rules grant access. Before you change the
default rule to deny access, be sure to use network rules to grant access to any
allowed networks. Next, explore the methods for managing default
network access rules. You can manage default
network access rules for storage accounts
through the Azure portal. Using PowerShell
and the Azure CLI. If you decide to use
the Azure portal, then follow these steps to
change default network access. Go to the storage
account you want to secure, select Networking. To restrict traffic from selected networks, select
Selected Networks. To allow traffic from all
networks, select All Networks. Finally, to apply your
changes, select Save.
