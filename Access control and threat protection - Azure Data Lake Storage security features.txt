Microsoft Azure Data
Lake Storage Generation 2 or Gen2 provides a first-class data
lake solution that enables enterprises to
consolidate their data. It's built on Azure
Blob Storage, so it inherits all the security features you
reviewed in this module. Along with role-based
access control or RBAC, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 provides Access Control Lists, ACLs, that are POSIX-compliant, and that restrict access
to only authorized users, groups, or service principles. It applies restrictions
in a way that's flexible, fine-grained,
and manageable. Azure Data Lake Storage
Gen2 authenticates through Azure Active Directory
OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens. This allows for flexible
authentication schemes, including federation with
Azure AD Connect and multi-factor authentication
that provides stronger protection
than just passwords. More significantly, these
authentication schemes are integrated into the main analytic services
that use the data. These services include Azure
Databricks, HDInsight, Azure Synapse Analytics, and management tools such as Azure Storage Explorer
are also included. After authentication finishes,
permissions are applied at the finest granularity to
ensure the right level of authorization for an
enterprise's big data assets. The Azure Storage end-to-end
encryption of data and transport layer
protections complete the security shield for
an Enterprise Data Lake. The same set of
analytics engines and tools can take advantage of these additional layers
of protection resulting in complete protection of
your analytics pipelines.
